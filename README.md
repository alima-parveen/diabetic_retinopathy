# Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis: Single-Task and Multi-Task Learning

This repository contains implementations of single-task and multi-task learning (MTL) models for diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading and lesion segmentation using the IDRiD dataset. Single-task models use VGG16 for grading and segmentation, while the MTL model uses MobileNetV2 with dynamic routing.
